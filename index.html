				<div class="bio-copy">
					<p>
						Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility, Michael is the creator of the
						<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org">Ruby On Rails Tutorial</a> and the principal author of the
						<a href="https://learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
						is also notorious as the founder of <a href="http://tauday.com">Tau Day</a> and the author of
						<a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a
						>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillian are slightly exaggerated.

					<p>
						When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can
						find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing
						some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorial

				<div class="bio-copy">
					<p>
						You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The
						Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding
						well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
